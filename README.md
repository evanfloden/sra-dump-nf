# SRA-DUMP-NF

Some ideas for pulling experiments directly from SRA. 

A SRA study number can be given with `--study` and all FASTQ files plus a metadata description of the experiment are downloaded. This can then be given used as input to any sequecnce read pipeline eg. [Kallisto-NF](https://github.com/cbcrg/kallisto-nf).

Very experimental and a work in progress.
